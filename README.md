# Hypixel Skyblock Remake v2

A project where I, mufin, am trying to recrate Hypixel Skyblock in Spigot. There is currently no download available, however you can import the project into your IDE of choice, along with adding the spigot jar as a dependency to export it.

[TOC]



## Current Features

### Utils

This plugin boasts a help menu using the Bukkit `/help` command. To use it, use `/help skyblock` or replace skyblock with any skyblock commands, for example, `/help setcoins`. This will show you a description, the usage and aliases if applicable. The plugin also follows a messaging guideline starting with [SB]. This means that any chat message that doesnt start with that prefix, is from Bukkit, Minecraft or another plugin.

### Playerdata

Playerdata is stored in 2 places. General playerdata, that needs to be accessed often, is put in the players NBT container. Collection data, however, is stored in a MySQL Database. Connecting to a database is pretty simple, just put the information in the config.yml file, and viola!

```yaml
sql:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 3306
  database: "minecraft"
  username: "skyblock"
  password: "plugin"
  useSSL: false
```

### Custom Items

You can create custom items using the `items.yml` file. simply format your item like this: (Material list can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html), stat value options can be found [here](#stat) and rarity options can be found [here](#rarity))

```yaml
TEST_ITEM:
  name: "&cTest Item"
  material: "MINECART"
  rarity: "SPECIAL"
  enchanted: true
  lore:
    - "&8Used for testing."
  stats:
    DAMAGE: 100
    STRENGTH: 50
```
